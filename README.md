#React-Formik-Form
The code for this exercise was created by faculty for MiT xPro's Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN course (August 2022 cohort). I made minor modifications to the appearance of the form in the CSS stylesheet.

###Project Description
This React exercise is from the course's Module 13: Introduction to JSX. Viewers will open an html web page that is a simple React Formik form. Upon typing text in the name, email, and password fields, if the viewer leaves the field blank, they will see a "Required" error message. Upon hitting the Submit button, viewers should see a message "Login successful."

###How to Locally Run the React-Formik-Form
From this React-Formik-Form repository, download the following files:
index.html
App.js
index.css
index.js
Next, open index.html in a browser window.

###Future Improvements
I have some redesign ideas for this project.
* I plan to change the CSS and experiment with Bootstrap and Tailwind.
* I plan to connect this to a database.
